### Start with a strong opening.
The first few pages of your book are crucial for grabbing the reader's attention. Introduce your characters and setting, and create a sense of mystery or suspense.

- Make your characters come alive with their ***thoughts, feelings, and actions***.
- Make it fun!

Children's books should be fun to read. Add humor, adventure, and excitement to your story, and make sure your characters are relatable and likable.

---

### Additional Tips:
- Use repetition and rhyme to help children remember the story.

  - Get feedback from other children to make sure your story is engaging and fun.

## 3a. How-to Plot a Children's Storybook
When plotting a children's book, you can follow the traditional outline of an inciting incident, a climax, and a resolution. You can also try breaking down the plot into steps: 

- Introduce the main character and the problem they face.

- Have the character try to solve the problem three times.

- Create a climax where the character thinks the solution will never happen

- Provide the perfect solution 

- Try to include a surprise ending. 

---

### 3b. Effective Plot
- Think about logic.
  - Explain logic to a 6 year old.
    - A set of rules that help us understand and make sense of things.
    - A game where we use our brains.
- Consider cause and effect.
  - Ask children to predict
    - Ask children to predict what will happen if they push a tower, for example.
  - Use the word "because"
    - The word "because" help's children understand why something happens.
  -  Ask questions
    - Have the character or narrator ask questions to help guide the audience (children) to understand what happened, what is going to happen, and ultimately why if happened.

--- 

The transitions from picture to picture and page to page should be logical and sequential. The plot should also be motivated by the main character's actions and illustrate the book's theme. You can also try looking around you for inspiration, such as your house, pets, or things your kids struggle with.
